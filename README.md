This bot is the SwarmLord, controller of the hordes.
Author: Scott Desai



The starting point code for this bot was used from the authors of another open source bot called Sludgement 2.
The original MIT license is retained in the SwarmLord bot.
From here new changes were made to keep the bot current with the current state of the competition.
